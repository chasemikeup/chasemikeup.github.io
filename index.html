		<p>You see, people run for different reasons. Some run to be a bit healthier, while others run because it's the only way to go to school.</p>
		
		<p>I run because I want to prove myself that I can. I run to think about everything, about nothing. I run because when I do, I feel like I can run forever without stopping, although this feeling doesn't last that long.</p>
		
		<p>I run </p>
		<ul>
			<li>in the morning</li>
			<li>during the time in between classes</li>
			<li>before the sun completely rises</li>
			<li>after the sun completely sets</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Also, I run to encourage people to do so, mainly on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chasemikeup/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p>
